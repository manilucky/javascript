//Prototypical inheritance




// Let's assume we have object o, with its own properties a and b:
// {a: 1, b: 2}
// o.[[Prototype]] has properties b and c:
// {b: 3, c: 4}
// Finally, o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null.
// This is the end of the prototype chain, as null,
// by definition, has no [[Prototype]].
// Thus, the full prototype chain looks like:
// {a: 1, b: 2} ---> {b: 3, c: 4} ---> null
var o ={a: 1, b: 2},
 var o.[[Prototype]] = {b: 3, c: 4};
console.log(o.a); // 1
// Is there an 'a' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 1.

console.log(o.b); // 2
// Is there a 'b' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 2.
// The prototype also has a 'b' property, but it's not visited. 
// This is called "property shadowing."

console.log(o.c); // 4
// Is there a 'c' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'c' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? Yes, its value is 4.

console.log(o.d); // undefined
// Is there a 'd' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'd' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? No, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null, stop searching,
// no property found, return undefined.
